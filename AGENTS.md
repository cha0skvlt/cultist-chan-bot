ðŸŽ¯ GOAL


goal: >
  Create a fully autonomous agent that:
  - hunts and joins token airdrops
  - analyzes and purchases valuable NFTs
  - communicates in Telegram as a living character
  - logs all actions to local database
  - evolves decision-making through embedded LLM (TinyLlama)
  - operates continuously with no human input

ðŸ’¬ LLM USAGE
Every external decision goes through LLM:

"Is this a good NFT?"

"Should I join this drop?"

"What should I say to the user now?"

Telegram replies are fully LLM-generated with persona templates.

âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA
query_llm() used in every decision path

Telegram messages formatted by persona.py

No hardcoded replies or NFT filters

Logs show LLM prompt + decision per action

Agent operates 24/7 with no manual input

ðŸ”„ Evolving
This agent is meant to evolve.
It learns indirectly via improved prompts, modules, and persona logic â€” not via training.
